# Verizon DDOS Attack
A large-scale Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack was launched against Verizonâ€™s core network infrastructure servicing the Washington, D.C. region. The sustained attack overwhelmed data centers and critical routing systems, crippling both commercial and public communications. Mobile networks, emergency services dispatch, internet connectivity, and VoIP systems across downtown D.C. were rendered inoperable, severely hindering coordination and response efforts.
