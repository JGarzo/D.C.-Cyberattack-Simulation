# Verizon DDOS Attack
A large-scale Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack was launched against Verizonâ€™s core network infrastructure servicing the Washington, D.C. region. The sustained attack overwhelmed data centers and critical routing systems, crippling both commercial and public communications. Mobile networks, emergency services dispatch, internet connectivity, and VoIP systems across downtown D.C. were rendered inoperable, severely hindering coordination and response efforts.
Byproduct: government shifts to secondary communication, cyber command spreads resources thin to bring back power and communications, isolation/confusion, increased civilian unrest, emergency services capabilities are hindered, legal tender is exclusively cash.
