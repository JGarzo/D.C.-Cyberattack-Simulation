# Proxy Phishing Attack
A targeted phishing attack against senior executives of the Capitol Power Plant in downtown Washington, DC successfully exploited their administrative access. The attackers deployed malware into the network, infiltrating critical systems and causing a widespread power outage across the region. The breach disrupted essential operations and left the city scrambling to restore services.
Byproduct: metro is shutdown, online banking institutions shut down, businesses/restaurants shut down, citizen unrest, public school canceled, water supply becomes contaminated, hospitals shift to backup generators.
