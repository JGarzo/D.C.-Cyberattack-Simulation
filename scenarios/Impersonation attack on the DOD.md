# Trojan Malware Attack 
During ongoing recovery efforts following a DDoS attack on Verizon, a sophisticated Trojan malware campaign exploited a trusted CISA analyst’s device. The analyst, authorized to assist with encrypted communication restoration, unknowingly facilitated attacker access into CISA’s internal infrastructure. From there, the threat actor pivoted into defense channels, deploying Trojan malware that masqueraded as an intelligence directive from senior Cyber Command leadership. The fraudulent communication requested privileged access to the Department of Defense’s secondary communication systems, appearing to contain critical threat intelligence. The operation leveraged trust, urgency, and legitimate credentials to bypass traditional security controls.
Byproduct: Citizens have begun rioting in the Washington Metropolitan Area, sensitive information from DoD has been collected, potential national security implications.
