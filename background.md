# Background
Overview 

The D.C. Cyberattack simulation unfolds in four escalating stages beginning with a phishing attack on the power grid, followed by a DDOS attack on communication networks, a Trojan infiltration of the Department of Defense via a spoofed CISA analyst, and the public release of classified military data finally culminating in a coordinated recovery effort across federal, local, and private entities.  

Participants must assume key roles ranging from the President to private sector CEOs, each of which has a key responsibility for making high-stakes decisions under pressure ensuring success. The primary objectives are to test cyber preparedness, improve interagency collaboration, enhance decision-making, reveal systemic vulnerabilities, and develop strategic communication responses. By the end of the simulation, participants will have restored vital systems, contained the threat, executed an effective media campaign, and developed actionable strategies to strengthen future resilience. This exercise not only highlights real-world risks and response dynamics but also fosters leadership, coordination, and critical thinking in the face of a national cyber emergency.
